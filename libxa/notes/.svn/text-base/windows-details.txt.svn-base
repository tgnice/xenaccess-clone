## Useful information
* Windows user/kernel split is at 2GB/2GB, so the kernel offset is 0x80000000
* PFN database at 0x80c00000
* PTE base at 0xc0000000
* each process has only one page directory
* page size is 0x1000 bytes (4k)
* PAE enabled (?)
* kernel image loaded at physical address 0x004de000
* ntoskrnl.exe is the first module on PsLoadedModuleList
* PsInitialSystemProcess symbol from ntoskrnl can be start of enumerating
  the processes.  Take the value of this symbol (which is a RVA) and add
  it to the PA for the kernel image to get the PA for the symbol
     e.g., 0x4de000 (PA)  + 0x90ef4 (RVA)  = 0x56eef4 (PA)

* one method for getting the ntoskrnl base address is to do the following:
  (1) find the base address of the IDT (which can be obtained with a SIDT
      call or by looking in the IDTR register.
      --> So actually the IDT base address etc is contained within AMDV’s
          VMCB or VT’s VMCS (i.e., for HVM domains it's in the VT hardware)
  (2) walk backwards in memory until you find the MZ that signifies the start
      of the PE image
  (3) that's it, you are done!

* Lots of kernel symbols listed around phys addr 0x0066a8f0
  -- starts at 00665c10

## Info from my version of windows xp sp2
* ntoskrnl.exe pysical base address is 0x004d7000.
  -- available using windgb in a local kernel session
  -- shows 0x804d7000 so there must be a linear map for at least some of
     kernel memory as in linux... 0x804d7000 - 0x80000000 = 0x004d7000
* PsLoaded ModuleList = 0x8055a620 on nopae
* PsLoaded ModuleList = 0x805533a0 on pae
* Running kernel version is 2600.xpsp_sp2_gdr.070227-2254
