pyxa -- A Python adapter for XenAccess by Brendan Dolan-Gavitt

If you'd rather perform introspection using python, instead of C, then this
adapter will help get you going.  Follow the steps below to use it.

1) Build and install XenAccess
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make
    make install
    ldconfig

2) Build and install pyxa
    python setup.py build
    python setup.py install

3) Start having fun with Python
    import pyxa
    xai = pyxa.pyxa_instance(2)  # 2 is the domain id
    xai.read(paddr, length)
    xai.get_cr3()
    xai.is_pae()
    xai.is_pse()


Once you have pyxa installed, you can write your own programs using Python or
you can use Volatility to perform your memory analysis.  To use Volatility,
you need to apply the included patch (pyxa_volatility.patch) to Volatility.
More information on Volatility and a link to download the tool, are available
